            <h3>Introduction to the "Implement" Phase</h3>
            <p>With a thoroughly vetted design in hand, we move into the Implementation phase. This is where our design vision becomes a tangible reality.</p>

            <h3>Development Collaboration</h3>
            <p>The design team works closely with the development team in this phase. Using tools like Figma Development Mode or hand-coded HTML/CSS, designers ensure their vision is perfectly translated into a live environment.</p>

            <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
            <p>Before launch, we rigorously test the design on multiple devices and browsers to ensure it’s both functional and visually consistent. It’s crucial that the design not only looks good but performs reliably under various conditions.</p>

            <h3>Launch and Deployment</h3>
            <p>Once Quality Assurance gives the green light, we prepare for a public launch. This involves a coordinated effort between design, development, and marketing teams to ensure a successful rollout.</p>

            <h3>Post-Launch Monitoring and Data Collection</h3>
            <p>The design process doesn’t end at launch. We continue to monitor user behavior and collect data, laying the groundwork for future updates and improvements.</p>
